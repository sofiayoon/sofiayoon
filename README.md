I am a software engineer intern at [edX](https://www.linkedin.com/school/edx/about/), and I love to build software that makes positive impact! <br>

I first started programming at Cornell, and I was instantly fascinated by it. I saw programming as a virtual lego project with snippets of code as its building blocks. I hope to continue to learn more about software development, while using the technical skills I gain for a greater good. 

As a rising senior majoring in computer science at Cornell University, I

🌱 Develop and lead software development projects for [Hack4Impact](https://www.cornellh4i.org/) <br>
✏ Teach Python and basics to programming in CS1110 Introduction to Computing Using Python <br>
🎵 Worked as a full stack developer for [rapStudy](https://rapstudy.com/)

I have experience with Django, React, Flask, and Firebase. 

Outside of programming, I am a travel and food enthusiast, and I have lived in 6 countries around the world!

I am a senior majoring in computer science at Cornell University College of Engineering, and I love to build software that makes positive impact! <br>

Most of my personal projects are unfortunately in Cornell’s Github Enterprise system where you need Cornell authentication, but feel free to explore smaller projects in this github account!

I first started programming at Cornell, and I was instantly fascinated by it. I saw programming as a virtual lego project with snippets of code as its building blocks. I hope to continue to learn more about software development, while using the technical skills I gain for a greater good.
